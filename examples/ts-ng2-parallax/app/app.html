<h1>Angular 2 Parallax - TypeScript</h1>

<p>
	Hi!  This is an example page to showcase how the Angular2 parallax directive works.  On the page are shown different examples of what the result is and what the configuration I used was in order to get the effect.  Please refer to the README.md for more information on the installation of this directive plugin.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Example 1 - Basic Parallax Effect</h3>

<p>
	This is how it looks if you just add the "parallax" attribute onto an element, then give it a width, height, and background-image property in your .css file
</p>
<div parallax id="first-example"></div>

<h5>HTML:</h5>
<pre>
	&lt;div parallax id="first-example"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<h5>CSS:</h5>
<pre>
    *[parallax] {
        width: 700px;
        height: 300px;
        
        background-size: 100%;
    }
    
    #first-example {
        background-image: url('./assets/dawn-190055.jpg');
    }
</pre>

<p>
	NOTE: Each of the examples are set up similarly as far as the styles go, so I'll leave you to decide on the styling.
</p>


<br>
<h3>Example 2 - Adding Configuration</h3>

<p>
	If you want to modify the effect, you can pass in a config object (definition found in the .ts file) that has the properties you want to override.
</p>
<div parallax [config]="{
	parallaxInitVal: -300,
	parallaxRatio: .3
}" id="second-example"></div>

<h5>HTML:</h5>
<pre>
    &lt;div parallax [config]="{
        parallaxInitVal: -300,
        parallaxRatio: .3
    }" id="second-example"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>
	Or define the config object in your component class and just pass the reference through the HTML.  Cool thing about this is that then you could use the ParallaxConfig interface exported with the directive to type-check what you're sending it.
</p>
<h5>TS:</h5>
<pre>
    @Component({ . . . })
    class AppComponent {
        <u><b>parallaxConfig</b></u>: ParallaxConfig = {
            parallaxInitVal: -300,
            parallaxRatio: .3
        };
		
        constructor() {}
    }
</pre>
<h5>HTML:</h5>
<pre>
    (preferred syntax)
    &lt;div parallax [config]="<u><b>parallaxConfig</b></u>" id="second-example"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	
    (alternative data-binding syntax)
    &lt;div parallax config="{{<u><b>parallaxConfig</b></u>}}" id="second-example"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>
	If all you're doing is changing one or two things, you can also reference those specific attributes through HTML instead of a config object:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;div parallax 
        [parallaxInitVal]="-300"
        [parallaxRatio]=".3"
    id="second-example"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>
	My preference is just use the config object, defined in HTML, though I've used the other strategies before, too.  Remember that with either of the data-binding syntaxes, you need to make sure that it make sense from a JavaScript standpoint (e.g. strings are strings, numbers are numbers, variables are variables).
</p>

<h3>Example 3 - Watching a Different Element's Scroll</h3>
<p>
	Suppose you want to track the scroll of a different element on the page that has a unique id (such as a scrolling route element on a separate component).  You can pass in a scrollerId that is the unique id for that element you want to track the scrolling of.  Now the div below isn't tracking the scrolling of the page, but of the element beneath it, moving the picture from left to right rather than right to left.
</p>
<div parallax [config]="{
	parallaxCss: 'backgroundPositionX',
	parallaxRatio: -3,
	scrollerId: 'special-scroll-3'
}" id="third-example"></div>
<div id="special-scroll-3" class="example-textboxes">
	<p>
		Bacon ipsum dolor amet tenderloin pork salami leberkas ham hock pork chop. Doner sirloin capicola brisket hamburger. Filet mignon flank jowl cow turkey ground round. Kielbasa jowl alcatra biltong, meatloaf chicken pastrami swine strip steak doner pork loin jerky porchetta chuck capicola. Tail brisket shoulder capicola doner meatball ham hock.
	</p>
	<p>

Spare ribs tri-tip ribeye cupim t-bone pig corned beef. Beef frankfurter sausage t-bone, ball tip landjaeger pastrami rump kevin doner.

Corned beef pork belly kevin, bresaola sausage filet mignon swine prosciutto capicola frankfurter ball tip.
	</p>
	<p>

Short loin turkey pork loin beef ribs boudin chicken jerky shankle salami meatball.
	</p>
</div>

<h5>HTML:</h5>
<pre>
    &lt;div parallax [config]="{
    	parallaxCss: 'backgroundPositionX',
    	parallaxRatio: -3,
    	scrollerId: 'special-scroll-3'
    }" id="third-example"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	
    &lt;div id="special-scroll-3"&gt;
        . . . CONTENT . . .
    &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>
	You could also specify the scrolling-watched element from the HTML via the ng2 special syntax of defining an element variable in the template.  Just be mindful that the '#' does gets included, not on the config object, but on the element you're wanting to pass into the object.
</p>

<h5>HTML:</h5>
<pre>
    &lt;div parallax [config]="{
    	parallaxCss: 'backgroundPositionX',
    	parallaxRatio: -3,
    	scrollElement: <u><b>scroller</b></u>
    }" id="third-example"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	
    &lt;div id="special-scroll-3" <u><b>#scroller</b></u>&gt;
        . . . CONTENT . . .
    &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>
	You also have the 'parallaxElement' option you can pass into the config object as well, if the element you're wanting the effect to apply to isn't the element you're putting the "parallax" attribute onto.  Usually, you would put the "parallax" attribute straight onto the element you'd want the scrolling to modify, but the option is open to you.  It'd be using the same syntax of "#" on the element you want it to apply to, however you can't currently pass in the string id of the parallax element.  That feature will be added if people request it.
</p>

<h3>Example 4 - Other "parallaxCss" Options</h3>
<p>
	We've only really been observing examples that affect an image, which may be the bulk of what you'd be using the parallax effect for.  However, it came to my attention while I was building <a href="https://github.com/cwadrupldijjit/stallion-security-ng2">this site (source code)</a> that it would be best if I could use this on other elements as the page scrolls (in this case, shrinking the header).  As such, here are a couple of examples modifying other portions of the page:
</p>
<h4 parallax [config]="{
	parallaxCss: 'left',
	parallaxRatio: 7,
	scrollElement: specialScroller4
}" id="fourth-example-text">I move when you scroll!</h4>
<img src="./app/assets/sun-151763_640.png" id="fourth-example-logo"
	parallax [config]="{
		parallaxCss: 'transform:rotate',
		cssUnit: 'deg',
		parallaxRatio: 5,
		maxValue: 170,
		minValue: -10,
		parallaxInitVal: -190,
		scrollElement: specialScroller4
	}">
<div id="special-scroll-4" class="example-textboxes" #specialScroller4>
	<p>
		Bacon ipsum dolor amet tenderloin pork salami leberkas ham hock pork chop. Doner sirloin capicola brisket hamburger. Filet mignon flank jowl cow turkey ground round. Kielbasa jowl alcatra biltong, meatloaf chicken pastrami swine strip steak doner pork loin jerky porchetta chuck capicola. Tail brisket shoulder capicola doner meatball ham hock.
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
</div>

<h5>HTML:</h5>
<pre>
    &lt;h4 parallax [config]="{
        parallaxCss: 'left',
        parallaxRatio: 7,
        scrollElement: specialScroller4
    }" id="fourth-example-text"&gt;I move when you scroll!&lt;/h4&gt;
	
    &lt;img src="./app/assets/sun-151763_640.png" id="fourth-example-logo"
        parallax [config]="{
            parallaxCss: 'transform:rotate',
            cssUnit: 'deg',
            parallaxRatio: 5,
            maxValue: 170,
            minValue: -10,
            parallaxInitVal: -190,
            scrollElement: specialScroller4
        }"&gt;
	
    &lt;div id="special-scroll-4" class="example-textboxes" #specialScroller4&gt;
        . . . CONTENT . . .
    &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>
	You can see that elements can move about according to the scroll, you can set maximum and minimum constraints, specify a different unit, and use special css syntaxes (in regards to the 'transform:rotate').  Most css attributes work when you plug it in to the parallaxCss property of the config, but you have to make sure it is in camelCase, and if it's a special property, (e.g. "rotate(VALUE)", "calc(VALUE)", "translate(VALUE)", etc.) that you add the ":" and the modifier without the parentheses and value ("rotate", "calc", etc.).  With that, you should be able to have no problems with the css properties you pass in.
</p>
<p>
	I would also like to mention that currently, this plugin doesn't support multiple properties being passed in and modified on scroll.  It is a possible future feature, but for now, the only way to do it is to pass in another function that modifies it further as I'll explain below.  Either that, or you can just write something by yourself to handle that.
</p>

</div>

<h5>HTML:</h5>
<pre>
    &lt;h4 parallax [config]="{
        <b>cb</b>: parallaxFn,
        <b>cb_context</b>: <u>colorChange</u>,
        <b>cb_args</b>: ['r', 250, 0, 250],
        scrollElement: <u>specialScroller5</u>
    }" id="fifth-example-text" <u>#colorChange</u>&gt;I move when you scroll!&lt;/h4&gt;
	
    &lt;div id="special-scroll-5" class="example-textboxes" <u>#specialScroller5</u>&gt;
        . . . CONTENT . . .
    &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<h5>TS:</h5>
<pre>
    @Component({ . . . })
	class AppComponent {
        parallaxFn(color: string, maxVal: number = 250, minVal: number = 0, otherValue: number = 0) {
            // put logic here
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>
	A lot is going on here.  I specified three new things in my parallax config object: "cb", "cb_context", and "cb_args".  "cb" is the callback function you'd want the parallax directive to call when it evaluates the scroll. "cb_context" is the context you want the function to run in, or the explicit "this" binding for the function. "cb_args" is an array of the arguments you want to pass into the function.  Because of the many moving parts that come into play when you specify a callback function for the parallax directive to run, I would suggest you try to acheive the affects you want without having to resort to this, but this is a viable option in case more complex logic is needed.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>
	There are some other considerations you should have when you use this that I'd like to mention before I am fully done with this test page.  First is you have to be careful how many properties you send into the ParallaxConfig via the html route.  By default, Angular 2 does not allow more than 9 properties defined in the html, and as such if you have a really large, complex ParallaxConfig object, you need to make sure that it will work if you define it in your host component's class.
</p>

<p>
	Callback functions are run synchronously.  Don't use any hefty process in the callback functions, as it can cause some negative affects on your page, and in the end gives the user a bad experience.  The lighter you make everything and the less you use the parallax effect on a single page, the better off this will be.
</p>

<p>
	Feedback and issues are very helpful in the development of this component.  It will be kept up-to-date with the development of Angular 2 as much as possible.  If you'd like to see this component in another form, post an issue for it on the <a href="https://github.com/cwadrupldijjit/ng2-parallax">GitHub page</a>, and I'll do my best to work on it and get back to you.  If you'd like to help with the development of this component, feel free to send me a message or email and I can add you as a collaborator or just send a pull request out.
</p>

<p>
	Above all, thanks for showing interest in this project!
